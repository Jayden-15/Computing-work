A fun Teachers' day gift project

It is teacher's day
I arrived at school early to prepare for the surprise.
When I entered the classrom, I saw people busy getting it together.
There were people blowing the balloons, putting up streamers, as well as preparing games.


The teachers arrived when the clock struck 9.
They stood at the threshold of the room, awe-struck, a grin plastered on their faces.
